The Football Picking Championship is a unique football picking
competition that consists of four different football picking games, each
with its own twist:
<br />
<br />
<b>Pro Football Pick'em:</b>
Against the Spread Pick'em with weekly bonus points for great picking
performances
<br />
<b>Pro Football Run It Up:</b>
A Survivor Style game where you get points for margin of victory
<br></br>
<b>College Six Pack:</b>
Pick six of the weeks biggest college matchups against the spread (with
confidence points!)
<br />
<b>College Survivor:</b>
Survivor for college football where you pick up to six teams to win each
week. Each team you lose reduces your number of picks for next week.

Your total points from all four of the games are combined into the
overall standings. The player with the most points at the end of the
season is crowned the Football Picking Champion!
