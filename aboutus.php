  <h3> About Us </h3>
  
The Football Picking Championship started as a competition between friends called the Dealers Championship Series. 
In 2012, this website was built to allow others to join and the competition was renamed the Football Picking Championship.
<br><br>
This website was built and is currently maintained by one of the original DCS participants, who can be reached at: ryan.d.schulz@gmail.com.
<br><br>
Thanks for your interest in this website and good luck!
